# Orbis Social

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ðŸš¨ Orbis Social SDK is a legacy product dedicated to Social. If you want to access our latest product, check [here](https://useorbis.com/)

Driven by developer feedback and a new role as a core developer in the Ceramic ecosystem,Â [Orbis](https://useorbis.com/)Â is expanding its focus beyond social to offer a simple and efficient gateway for storing and managing open data on Ceramic. 

OrbisDB is a new open-source relational database designed for onchain builders - authentification, crypto plugins, hosted service, and built-in dashboard.

Existing users? Orbis Social SDK is going nowhere for now, it will continue functioning as usual (no deprecation of existing features). Once ready, it will be migrated to OrbisDB (including an SDK upgrade and a direct access to our Hosted Studio). However, Orbis Social has been put in maintenance mode (bug fixes, no major changes). We recommend developers to have the most advanced and riched experience to migrate now to OrbisDB.

## Build decentralized social apps with the Orbis SDK
By using the Orbis SDK, developers can build their own decentralized social apps or add a decentralized social features to their existing application in a very easy and performant way.
