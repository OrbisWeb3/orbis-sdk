# Build decentralized social apps with the Orbis SDK
By using the Orbis SDK, developers can build their own decentralized social apps or add a decentralized social features to their existing application in a very easy and performant way.

## Why you should build on Orbis
By being built on top of Ceramic, Orbis offers many advantages to developers interested in building decentralized social applications:

- No transaction fees
- Users donâ€™t have to sign a message for each action they take
- Write times are very fast which offers a user experience similar to web2
- Every piece of content shared on Orbis is decentralized on the Ceramic network and anyone can access it
- There is a full composability between apps built on the Orbis ecosystem
- (Coming soon) Multichain: Users can join Orbis using additional chains such as Cosmos or Solana and interact together in the same digital space

## Use cases
Here are some examples of applications that could be built on top of Orbis:

- Full social apps like [orbis.club](https://app.orbis.club)
